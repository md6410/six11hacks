\section{Physical Hacking}

There is a growing community of self-described \textit{makers} who
design and build many kinds of physical
things~\cite{gershenfeld-fab}. Some are electronic or robotic gizmos,
while others are composed of traditional material but designed or made
with modern technology. The ranks of these ``new
makers''~\cite{gross-new-makers} include mechanical engineers,
industrial designers, artists, computer programmers, architects, and
many others. It is common for these people to be relatively untrained
in aspects of their craft, such as using modeling software, desiging
or assembling electronics, or making visually appealing physical
constructions. It is rare to find any individual person that is an
expert in all of these topics, but it is common that a person knows
something about a lot of them.

It is possible that we are beginning to see a shift from an economy
based on mass-production (in factories) to one that includes
mass-customization (in homes and community centers). Rapid fabrication
machines continue to decline in price while improving in quality. It
is conceivable that in the not-so-distant future, small manufacturing
machines will be as common as desktop printers~\cite{economist-fab}. A
new sector of small businesses use rapid fabrication to cater to the
needs of hobbyist designers as well as people that need highly
customized goods (e.g. prosthetic limbs)~\cite{nyt-rapidfab}.

The surge of home manufacturing is made possible by a number of
related factors. First, there is a trend away from a culture of
consumption towards a culture of production. This is most visibly
reflected in the democratization of modern media where the users
become the dominant producers of content (e.g. social networking
systems like Facebook or the game Minecraft). People are once again
beginning to participate in the design of the world around them.

Second, there is a developing support structure for the new makers,
including physical shared space, Internet resources, magazines, and
conferences. \textit{Hacker spaces} are physical locations where
people can meet, share ideas, and work on projects. Hacker spaces
commonly have various tools and supplies available to members. Online
stores such as Sparkfun and model sharing sites like Thingiverse and
3D Warehouse give hackers easy access to supplies. There are several
Internet-based companies (e.g. Pokono) that offer fabrication
services. O'Reilly's \textit{Make Magazine} is a popular periodical
catering to this community. O'Reilly also puts on several
\textit{Maker Faire} gatherings every year where physical hackers can
meet.

Last, physical hacking is made accessible by the availability of rapid
fabrication machines like 3D printers, CNC mills, and laser
cutters. This work focuses on projects that use laser
cutters. Figure~\ref{fig:prices} shows prices for a
comparable~25-Watt,~16''x12'' laser cutter model from Universal Laser
Systems. These values were found on hobbyist web forums. While these
data may not be exact, they do show the price of desktop laser cutting
machines has been cut by almost half in the past ten years. While
still out of reach for most people to afford, they are becoming
inexpensive enough for schools and hacker spaces to own.

Laser cutters (and other rapid fabrication machines) are a relatively
new addition to the design studio. Further, many of the people using
laser cutters are avocational designers that lack formal design
education.

I am currently conducting interviews and observations to better
understand how people think about, model, and make things using laser
cutters. In addition to these interviews I have several years of
exposure and some direct experience on this topic.

\subsection{Laser Cutters and Laser Cut Items}

A laser cutter can be thought of as a very fast, strong, and precise
automated razor blade. They cut through flat material (paper, wood,
plastic, metal, etc.) from directly above.

Some items can be made entirely with a laser cutter. These projects do
not involve other forms of machinery, aside from the occasional screw
or glue. Other projects might be made partly with a laser cutter, and
partly with other machines. Sometimes an artifact is designed with to
allow it to interact with another object that already exists. This
places additional constraints on the design because it must conform to
existing measurements. The car-mounted smart phone holder in
Figure~\ref{fig:phone-holder} is one such example. If we are given
another similar device with slightly different dimensions, we might
simply change some parameters and cut another holder.

     particular device and mounted on the dash of a car (by Davide
     Prato).}
   \label{fig:phone-holder}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Software Modeling Tools}

Rapid fabrication hardware requires software. Currently, modeling
tools for rapid fabrication are almost exclusively designed for
professional, expert users. The personal computing industry was only
able to take off when intuitive interfaces were developed that allowed
ordinary people to use them. If rapid fabrication is to become common,
software modeling tools must be made accessible by ordinary
users~\cite{lipson-homefactory}.

Today, designers can choose among several modeling tools for laser
cutter projects. As a minimum requirement, the tool must be able to
produce a vector graphics file, where colors indicate which action the
laser takes (e.g. cut through material or etch into it). Adobe
Illustrator is the most commonly used package. Others include Rhino,
InkScape, AutoCAD, and SolidWorks.

Illustrator is a general-purpose vector graphics tool. Specialized
design tools like Rhino or SolidWorks are perhaps more appropriate for
modeling, but many people are already familiar with Illustrator from
other 2D graphics projects. For those unfamiliar with any of these
tools, Illustrator is viewed as the most approachable because it is
seen as having the easiest learning curve.

The designers I have interviewed have substantially different
backgrounds. All have training in some form of design, ranging from
mechanical engineering to graphic design to architecture. I began by
asking each person to describe how they work. Each designer was able
to show me sketches or videos of their work. While there are subtle
(and some substantial) differences in their processes, each followed
the following pattern.

They begin by thinking about a problem and making drawings by
hand. Some sketches are made to think about how to frame the project
(what is it for), while others help reason about how to make it (how
it works, how it fits together). Some designers explicitly noted that
sketching is a necessary part of the process; it would not be possible
to move forward without making freehand drawings. When the idea is
reasonably well-formed they will implement the model with a software
tool. It is common for this to involve translating a hand-made sketch
to a computer model (Figure~\ref{fig:translating-to-computer}). 

Following the interview about past design projects, I gave
participants a sketch (Figure~\ref{fig:interview-sketch}) and asked
them the implement it using their software tool of choice. The purpose
of this task was to learn what problems people met when executing the
common task of translating a sketch to a computer model.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{img/laser-me-2.jpg}
}
\caption{Sketches given to participants to implement in modeling software.}
\label{fig:interview-sketch}
\end{figure}

To design an object suitable for laser cutting, participants used
Illustrator (3 users) or Rhino (1 user). In all cases, a designer's
strategy involved a number of common tasks: creating or editing
boundaries, aligning or snapping items, using guide lines or reference
points, measuring distances, specifying or changing lengths and
angles, and creating finished ``cut files'' to send to the laser
cutter. These tasks are in addition to selecting/deselecting, zooming,
panning, and so on.

Participants in this experiment spent a good deal of time on operating
overhead. Overhead includes (1) trying to find the appropriate tool
for the next task, and (2) recovering from errors made when the wrong
tool was selected, or (3) when the tool did not behave consistently
with the user's intention. I have not performed an analysis of the
low-level actions people performed (using GOMS or
similar\cite{unknown}), however I estimate that in my experiments,
more than 50\% of a designers time is spent this way.

For example, one user was aware of Illustrator's ``Path Finder'' tool
and wanted to use it. This user searched the program's menu structure
and hovered over buttons to read tool tips before finding it. Next,
the designer invoked various functions of the Path Finder, using the
keyboard shortcut to undo after each attempt, as he searched for the
correct mode within the Path Finder's subcommand palette. This process
lasted approximately 80 seconds before finally being able to continue.

Participants used the Undo function routinely. The dominant use of
this was to revert after making a single failed attempt to edit some
element. There were a few instances where the designer believed their
current approach was flawed in such a way that it would be better to
back up several dozen operations because a single decision early on
was now observed to be problematic. This is consistent with the study
by Akers \textit{et. al} on the use of undo~\cite{akers-undo}.

One may argue that the problems associated with operating overhead can
be solved by experience or by addressing particular usability
problems. Obviously, masterful Illustrator or Rhino users exist and
would have no problem executing the design task from my
experiment. However, the target audience for this research is
avocational users, not experts.

Cooper argues that the set of people that are truly expert users is
not only quite small, it also changes over time
\cite{cooper-inmates}. A person might become an expert and sustain
that status for some time, but eventually stops using the program as
often, and eventually becomes an intermediate user. A substantial
portion of \textit{perpedual intermediate}.

\section{Implications for Design}

The design observations described above account for a relatively small
slice of hackers designing for laser cutters. It would be unwise to
base an entire research agenda on these few interviews. However, the
current proposal is based on much more than these observations. I have
several years of experience working in an environment where both
undergraduate and graduate students made things with rapid fabrication
machines (including a laser cutter). The recently conducted interviews
validate the observations I have been making for years: current design
tools are hard to learn, provide poor interaction for novice or
occasional users, and do not support idea exploration or informal
representation that is so important during early design.

I am interested in developing an alternate basis of interaction that
is easier and more effective for typical non-expert designers. The
interviews and observations from my study confirm that using current
tools involve a great deal of needless overhead for the target
population.
