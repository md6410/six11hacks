		   Notes on laser cutter interviews


			   == Interview 1 ==

User is a young maker of physical stuff and has a background in
architecture and product design/development. Has been doing rapid fab
prototyping and dev for about 3 years.

Primarily uses Rhino for 2D and 3D modeling projects. Will use
Illustrator/Photoshop to do 'finished' drawings destined for client
consumption (renderings and so on). He has a lot of experience making
physical things so he is skilled in finding problems in a design based
on a sketch, and sometimes doesn't need to even make a drawing to
reason about how something will (or won't) work.

Observations and "Problems" faced by this user: (scare quotes because
some are not so much 'problems' as they are things that seemed
inefficient to me)

* Material properties mattered very early on, particularly for getting
  some dimensions correct.

* It seemed to be important to have the scale set properly at the
  beginning.

* Would not model many things in 3D because it is easy enough to do in
  2D and just know how they go together. Exceptions are when things
  are bent or join together at weird angles.

* Given the sketch the user could immediately specify many dimensions,
  but some were missing so he had to 'rough it'. He ended up using
  existing geometry (whose dimensions were specified) to guide
  placement of the things he was estimating. E.g. placing the notch
  directly below the corner above. The corner served as an anchor.

* Rhino lets you enter commands by typing their names (sort of like a
  command line). 

* Used construction lines and existing geometry as
  references. Frequetly used structured editing abilities to do things
  like make two oddly-angled lines parallel, or to nudge a boundary by
  X millimeters. He would commononly make too many lines and erase
  them later. This was a repeated tactic.

* Constantly zooming in to adjust geometry and zooming out to see if
  it looks ok.

* Creating the cutfile was something of an art: he made an artificial
  cut bed by drawing a 16"x24" rectangle (the size of the physical
  laser cutter bed). Then he copied the part and pasted/rotated/moved
  the copies inside the rectangle and tried to use the material
  efficiently by packing them tightly.

* When starting a new laser cutter project, his first step was to
  measure the physical thing the new project wil fit on. This involved
  a quick sketch and writing down the numeric dimensions.

* Within the tool, modal issues caused minor problems. At one point,
  he was trying to get the mouse to snap to a certain point but it
  wouldn't until he noticed he had to enter a mode. This wasn't that
  time consuming, but it was distracting.

* When making a curve, he used a Bezier spline tool and fidgeted
  around a bit to get it looking correctly.

* He characterizes his process as involving the following:

	  Thinking <--> Sketching <--> Modeling <--> Making

  While the project starts with thinking and ends with making, it is
  fully possible and likely that the designer's attention can flip
  between any of these processes as work goes on. For example, there's
  a lot of thinking done before sketching, though sketching nicely
  complements thinking. And the designer might make a first physical
  version with the understanding that errors and issues will be found,
  which fuels additional thinking/sketching/modeling.
