Abstract.

Motivation.

(the problem we are addressing)

  - Editing two dimensional freehand drawings and curves (drawing, CAD?)
  - WIMP interfaces are designed with the mouse in mind [Ramos]
  - existing methods for editing curves (e.g., editing by control points, overtracing)
               and what is wrong with these methods
  - Flow select is used for operating on portions of a stroke. 
  - Used to quickly select a portion of a drawn stroke and correct

Technique.

  - Pen input normalized to sequences of points of uniform distance
  - Modeless interaction:
    - Pen strokes are interpreted as ink until it has reason to reinterpret
    - Holding the pen down at the same spot begins a flow select
      - To account for shaky hands, pen must be held within some radius rather than at a single pixel location
    - Point on a stroke nearest the pendown is the epicenter
    - Before selection begins, each point along stroke is assigned an 'effort' value
      - Most obvious 'effort' value is arc distance from pendown
      - Less obvious 'distance' is function of arc distance and other things:
        - Curvature (e.g. so selection progresses more slowly over a curve than a straight section)
	- Corners (e.g. so selection stops temporarily or permanently at a sharp corner)
      - effort function is pluggable for quick experimentation during prototyping
      - effort function is nondecreasing from epicenter, which has zero effort
    - Selection strength of each point
      - Flows outward from epicenter as a function of time and (pt.effort / total.effort)
      - Strength is 0..1 (0 means not selected, 1 means fully selected)
      - A few selection strength functions, with x = pt.effort / total.effort
      -  Linear: max (0, 1 - x)
      -  Polynomial: max (0, 1 - x^y) for some value of y, such as 2
      -  Trigonometric: 1 - ((-cos(Ï€ * x)) + 1) / 2 , for x <= 1, 0 for x > 1
      - The trig function is the 'best' selector because it
         asymptotically approaches full selection for 'near' points
         and asymptotically approaches no selection for 'distant'
         points -- it's first derivative is zero at x=0 and x=1
    - Moving the pen causes flow selection to and and an operation to begin.
    - Default operation is a move, which moves each point a scaled
       amount according to its selection strength; if I move my mouse
       by 2,1, a point that is .25 selected will move by .5, .25
    - Holding the pen again shifts into a smoothing operation
      - Smoothing is an iterative process that tweens a selected
        region towards a natural cubic spline.
      - If a sequence is close enough to the current spline, a new
        spline with fewer control points is constructed based on the
        current selection, until there is only a straight line
      - Smoothing stops when the user either lifts the pen, or moves
        it. If the user moves the stylus without lifting it, moving
        back to the move operation
  - After lifting the stylus, future scribbles are interpreted as ink  

Applications.

  - Users initial reaction is uniformly 'wow'
  - Currently in early prototype phase, only have proof-of-concept
  - Specific things we think this would be good for:

    - The 'modeless' aspect lends itself to a more fluid user experience
    - A quick correction technique for novices using a diagramming or
      cartoon sketch tool
    - Professional graphics packages (vector or raster)
      - feathered selection
      - controlling gradual operation functions such as brightness/contrast in context

Future Work.
  - extension to 3D; work with selecting not only curved lines but curved surfaces and volumes
  - Gestures:
    - flow select followed by a pen gesture to choose an operation
    - pen gesture followed by flow select (followed by a pen gesture, and so on)
    - example: south/north/hold ==> menu
    - example: circle/hold ==> color chooser
    - example: flow-select/pigtail ==> delete selection
  - toolkit / application embedding
