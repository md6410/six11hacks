This is an example of chapter text. This is an example of intext reference citation ``Mathematical Theory of Communication,'' Claude Shannon [1] pointed out that as the bandwidth tends to infinity, the
channel capacity of an ideal bandlimited additive white Gaussian
noise channel approaches ....The following is an example of display equation in chapter
\begin{equation}
\lim_{B\rightarrow \infty} B \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{P}{BN_0}\right) =
\frac{P}{N_0}\log_2 e {\rm b/s}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the received power and N0 is the one-sided noise spectral
level. Since capacity is monotonically increasing with bandwidth $B$,
the right side of (1.1) is the maximum rate achievable with power $P$.
Moreover, communicating at rate $R$, the received signal energy per
information bit is equal to
\begin{equation}
E^r_b =\frac{P}{R},
\end{equation}
and since the maximum value of $R$ is the right side of (1.1), the minimum
received signal energy per information bit required for reliable
communication satisfies
\begin{equation}
\frac{E^r_b}{N_{0_{\rm min}}} = \frac{P}{N_0\frac{P}{N_0}\log_2
                           e}=\log_e2= -1.59{\rm dB.}

This is an example of Bulleted List:
\begin{itemize}
\item{}
On-off signaling approaches capacity as the duty cycle vanishes.
\item{}
The derivative at zero signal-to-noise ratio of the Shannon
capacity determines the wideband fundamental limits.
\item{}
Capacity is not affected by fading.
\item{}
Receiver knowledge of channel fade coefficients is useless.
\item{}
An input whose mutual information achieves the derivative
of capacity at zero signal-to-noise ratio is wideband optimal.

This is an example of chapter text. This is an example of intext reference citation ``Mathematical Theory of Communication,'' Claude Shannon [1] pointed out that as the bandwidth tends to infinity, the
channel capacity of an ideal bandlimited additive white Gaussian
noise channel approaches ....

\section{Example of section head}

The following is an example of display equation in chapter
\begin{equation}
\lim_{B\rightarrow \infty} B \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{P}{BN_0}\right) =
\frac{P}{N_0}\log_2 e {\rm b/s}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the received power and N0 is the one-sided noise spectral
level. Since capacity is monotonically increasing with bandwidth $B$,
the right side of (1.1) is the maximum rate achievable with power $P$.
