Revisions:

* Explain limitations of task/tool analysis. 

    --> Added paragraphs at the end of the relevant section.

* What principles might future researchers and developers learn from
  your experience, and apply to achieve a harmonious set of
  interaction techniques?

    --> Expanded the "Implications to Related Areas" section in the
        concluding chapter. I explain four heuristics: (1) leverage
        context; (2) Substantial shape differences improve recognition
        and user experience; (3) Rely on visual reinforcement and
        physical metaphors; (4) Make use of the staged architecture.

* Explain the possible broader application of the recognition
  architecture. This will make your work relevant and interesting to
  researchers and developers in domains beyond sketching.

    --> Added a subsection in the Overview chapter that talks about
        where new recognizers might be put as a function of when it is
        necessary to activate them, and how many strokes are involved.

* Speculate about how the recog architecture could be used in other
  domains.
* "Capturing all three in a single gestural phrase" is a powerful
  idea: elaborate.

    --> Added two paras to the 'Interaction Design' subsection in the
conclusion.


* Provide a more thorough conclusion including a prospectus for future
  work.

    --> Added a new section at the very end, "Looking Forward". 


* Change your thesis title to what you have presented

    --> ok

* Add explanations of SIMI vs Illustrator comparison

    --> Clarified protocol in table 6.1, expanded discussion in ch 6
        and in conclusion

* Acknowledge and discuss why not features - e.g., symmetry,
  copy-paste, parallel, etc. rather than implementing a complete list
  of all possible features, the selected ....

    --> Added section 'Justification of Feature Choices' in
        conclusion.
