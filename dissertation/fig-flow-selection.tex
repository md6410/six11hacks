    selection. Most of the time, users simply press the pen down, draw
    some ink, and release. But if they hold the pen down, the flow
    selection states are reached. The user holds down the pen to
    select a region, moves the pen to move the selection, and holds it
    still once again to smooth the selection. Lifing the pen ends the
    process.}
