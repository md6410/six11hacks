\\

Line &

Straight line connecting two points.

\\

Elliptical Arc &

Elliptical arc that passes through two points on an ellipse. The
ellipse is defined with a centroid, a major and minor radius, and an
angle of rotation. The endpoints are defined with angular offsets.

\\

Ellipse &

An ellipse defined like the elliptical arc, except it is a closed
shape.  

\\ 

Circle &

A circle is a closed shape defined by a center point and radius. SIMI
does not include a corresponding circular arc.

\\ 

Spline &

A cardinal spline made of start/end points, and a parameter list
determining control point locations relative to the start and end.

\\ 

Blob &

A Blob is a closed spline.

\\ 

Dot &

A Dot is represented as a single point. It is recognized when the
input stroke is very short.
