\\

Line &

Straight line connecting two points.

\\

Elliptical Arc &

Arc that passes through two points on an ellipse. The ellipse is
defined with a centroid, a major and minor radius, and an angle of
rotation. The endpoints are defined with angular offsets.

\\

Ellipse &

An ellipse defined like the elliptical arc, except it is a closed
shape.  

\\ 

Circle &

A circle is a closed shape defined by a center point and radius. SIMI
does not include a corresponding circular arc.

\\ 

Spline &

A cardinal spline composed of start/end points, and a list of
parameters that determine control point locations relative to the
start and end points.

\\ 

Blob &

A Blob is a closed spline.
