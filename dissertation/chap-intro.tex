\chapter{Introduction}

Short, almost meta. Begin with a ~500 word summary of what the
dissertation is about: rapid fab, sketch interfaces, my tool, and what
the contributions are. Have to be very clear about the contributions:
why the problem is interesting, how I can be sure I have addressed it,
and why my work is a unique contribution.

\section{Intended Audience}

Thesis is mostly aimed at researchers in sketch-based modeling, but
people involved in CAD (academic and professional) and the DIY hacker
crowd will probably find it interesting.

\section{Motivation}

Talk about motivation from both academic and practical
perspectives. From the acad perspective we have an interest in
exploring ways to bring together disparate sketch-based interaction
techniques to form a coherent whole. From a practical perspective we
want more ``natural'' tools that allow us to think more freely,
without being tied down to what some structured tool demands.
