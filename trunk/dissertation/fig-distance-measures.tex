  \caption[Euclidean vs. Curvilinear Distance]{Two ways to measure
    distance: Euclidean vs. Curvilinear. The Euclidean distance from A
    to B is direct ($length=18$). Curvilinear distance from A to B
    follows the path indicated ($length=86$). Each measurement
    approach has a related midpoint, indicated as smaller dots.}
