• You claim that in SIMI, the set of interaction techniques work well
  together. Accepting this claim, what principles might future
  researchers and developers learn from your experience, and apply to
  achieve a harmonious set of interaction techniques?

• Explain the possible broader application of the recognition
  architecture. This will make your work relevant and interesting to
  researchers and developers in domains beyond sketching.

Jason mentioned that, although many/most recognition based systems use
a similar approach, we are unfamiliar with a clear architectural
explanation as you have articulated it.  Specifically: (a) If (for
example) one were to add a new recognizer to the system, how would one
know where in the architecture to insert it? (b) (How) might this
architecture be useful to recognizer based systems in other domains?
"Capturing all three in a single gestural phrase" is a powerful idea:
elaborate.

• Provide a more thorough conclusion including a prospectus for future
  work.
