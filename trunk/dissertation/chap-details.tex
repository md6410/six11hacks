\chapter{Sketch It, Make It: Details}

This is the details chapter. It describes the recognition strategy
involving ink parsing, and how it recognizes various things like
glyphs (rotation invariant pictograms) or gestures (grammar-based like
erase).

This will be a dry chapter but it should be the most useful to anybody
else who wants to work on this. Should be enough that a smart grad
student can implement things based on just what is here.
