Two big, high level topics: Design and Sketching.

\section{Design for Rapid Fabrication}

There are many domains where people use rapid fabrication and prototyping machines:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mechanical Engineering
\item Architecture
\item Crafts
\item Industrial Design
\item ... and so on
\end{itemize}

Often people in these domains are engaged in ``physical hacking'', and
while they may have different domain expertise, these people use the
same kinds of tools:

\begin{itemize}
\item Software modeling tools (e.g. CAD)
\item Physical modeling tools (e.g. clay, wood, foam, paper)
\item Rapid fabrication machines
\end{itemize}

Among the rapid fab machines, we have:

\begin{itemize}
\item 3D printing
\item CNC Mills
\item Water jet cutters
\item Laser cutters
\end{itemize}

The focus of this thesis is on a sketch-based tool for laser
cutting. But while the narrow domain in question is rapid fabrication
using laser cutters, it is situated in the broader context of digital
modeling tools, so it should have applications to any designer that
uses computers to aid design. This accounts for nearly all designers,
so the implications are very broad.

\section{Sketching}

Need a paragraph to talk about the relationship between design,
designers, and their tools. Sketching is a significant activity
here. 

\subsection{Traditional Sketching}

Copy in the part of the lit review on traditional sketching and edit
it down. Be sure to also talking about pragmatic vs. epistemic
actions, and the tentative, explorational nature of design sketching.

\subsection{Computational Support for Sketching}

Distinguish between ``faithful'' and ``faux'' sketching
systems. Faithful tools respect the tentativeness of physical
sketching where people don't have all the answers at the start. Faux
sketching systems are named so because the developers view their tools
as being fast, but they do not support sketching as on paper.

Within computational support for sketching there are a bunch of
technical areas to look at. Can crib a lot from the lit review. The
sections that are most important are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Ink Parsing (corner finding, segmentation)
\item Recognition
\item Domain modeling
\item Graphics (rectification, rendering)
\item Interaction techniques, interaction design
\end{itemize}
