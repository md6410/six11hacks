@book{weisberg-cad-history,
	Annote = {This is an interesting history of CAD. I found it referenced from the Wikipedia page on CNC, but the web site where it is supposed to be hosted is dead. I found something on scribd but I can't download the whole thing. You can read it online, but it is spread out over many files (1 per chapter).

The part I wanted to check out is in chapter 3, page 10, where the author states that MIT researchers wondered in the 1950s that once CAD was a reality whether or not paper-based representations (and hand-drawing) would ever be needed again.

Obviously, we might put faith in digital models for archiving and for controlling cnc and rapid fabrication machines, but designers still use paper.},

	'seamless': There are no seams between the whiteboard and participants. It is easy to switch focus from one to the other or to perceive both simultaneously. Seams introduce opportunity for distraction and should be avoided.

I think pen computing can fill a very important niche for most users as a `quiet' note-taking technology (I find laptops to be socially rude, as pointed out in one of the footnotes). For a smaller segment of the population, tablets with proper software (sketch recognition and interaction design) might support designing and thinking. Nobody (except for the guys who founded GO, and even they seem to have changed their minds) appears to believe pen computers are the panacea of general-purpose computing.},

But this paper explains that the way people draw symbols doesn't substantially change based on task.

The second thing is that they developed a multi-stroke version of the \$1 recognizer.},

	Annote = {Discusses how software inappropriately compels users to formalize their work, and that impedes flow of thought.

Computers might need structured information. For example, this box on the screen isn't just a box, but it represents a book. This other box represents a library. The presence of a link between the two indicates the book is owned by the library. Without formal, structured knowledge, the computer has no awareness of books, libraries, or ownership. That might be perfectly OK if the user is working informally, as the human has tacit knowledge that is part of the model but not specifically encoded in the system. But if the system compels the user to specify information that is not important, it necessarily consumes the user's focus of attention.

The paper also suggests techniques to minimize the problems associated with formalization, including (my favorite soap box) support for incremental formalization and reconceptualization.},

Its design goal is to support useful interaction using only the natural affordances available to people standing around a whiteboard (pens and their bodies). It senses both sketch input as well as human proximity to the display. The authors explicitly avoid keyboard-and-mouse interaction (e.g. dialog boxes) as these are not appropriate for sketch interaction.

They describe a interaction framework with two dimensions: Attentional Demand (Foreground/Background) and Initiative (Reactive/Proactive) to describe how the user and system interact. This is useful when describing (for example) how recognition or rectification activities can transpire, or how users might switch tools/modes, how much work is done by the system, and how much of the user's attention is consumed by babysitting the system.},

I am particularly interested in pages 96--7 in chapter 4 where he writes the following:

An engineering drawing starts with a series of freehand sketches or
roughly scaled drawings to help visualize how the object being
designed will work and how the finished drawings must be made in order
to show a reader exactly what the ddesiner had in mind. Because design
is a complexs intellectual process, the designer uses sketches to try
out new ideas, to compare alternatives, and (this is important) to
capture fleeting ideas on paper.

Three kinds of sketches can be identified. The first is the _thinking
sketch_. Leonardo's notebooks contain dozens of such sketches (see,
eg.g. figure 4.18), and a host of later engineers have used sketches
to focus and guide nonverbal thinking. The next is the _prescriptive
sketch_ (e.g., figure 4.19), whic his sometimes scaled and which is
made by an engineer to direct a drater in making a finished
drawing. Thomas E. French, whose pioneering college textbook _A Manual
of Engineering Drawing_ and its successors have been used by 2 million
students, declared that "the designer must be able to _sketch_ his
ideas with a sure hand and clear judgement. In all inventive
mechanical thinking, in all preliminary designing, in all explanation
and instructions to draftsmen, freehand sketching is the mode of
expresion....It is the chief engineer's method of design."

The third kind of sketch, produced constantly in exchanges between
technical people, is the _talking sketch_ (figure 4.20). In the 1980s,
a young engineer in the design division of a "mid-size, mid-tech"
machine works equipped with computer-assisted design equipment,
commented on her initial surprise at the customary mode of
communication. Two designers never "just sit down and just talk," she
said. "Everybody draws sketches to each other." Some designers would
take early versions of their new designs to the fabricating shops in
order to solicit suggestions for improvements. In going over a drawing
with a welder, one senior designer regularly made "little hand
sketches off to one side" in order to clarify complex and possibly
confusing parts of the drawing. Kathryn Henderson, a sociologist who
is studying the politics of engineering design at first hand in design
departments of several industries, remarked on the way talking
sketches were made: she "observed designers actually taking the pencil
from one another as they talked and drew together on the same
sketches." Those talking sketches, spontaneously drawn during
discussion with colleagues, will continue to be important in the
process of going from vision to artifact. Such sketches make it easier
to explain a technical point, because all parties in a discussion
share a common graphical setting for the idea being debated."},

@inproceedings{davis-sketchwizard,
	Abstract = {SketchWizard allows designers to create Wizard of Oz prototypes of pen-based user interfaces in the early stages of design. In the past, designers have been inhibited from participating in the design of pen-based interfaces because of the inadequacy of paper prototypes and the difficulty of developing functional prototypes. In SketchWizard, designers and end users share a drawing canvas between two computers, allowing the designer to simulate the behavior of recognition or other technologies. Special editing features are provided to help designers respond quickly to end-user input. This paper describes the SketchWizard system and presents two evaluations of our approach. The first is an early feasibility study in which Wizard of Oz was used to prototype a pen-based user interface. The second is a laboratory study in which designers used SketchWizard to simulate existing pen-based interfaces. Both showed that end users gave valuable feedback in spite of delays between end-user actions and wizard updates.},

	Annote = {"Non-designers" are often involved in the design process. This can be useful since they are stakeholders, but may be problematic because they lack skills and experience. In order to empower these non-designers to make better contributions, the authors describe a simple Powerpoint toolkit for letting people create web pages that conform to guidelines.

There is no discussion of the task of specifying the guidelines, which are essentially constraints on what combinations or relations of UI elements are valid. Gerhard Fischer calls this 'meta design', and it seems that any design tool---especially those for non-designers---must address and support meta design.

The experience report also discusses the social constraints ("pain points", as they call them) extracted from user interviews. There are no surprises: ease of use, unwillingness to learn another tool, etc. This may be particular to these users, who were all MBAs.},

@phdthesis{simhon-wavelet-sketch,

	Annote = {Simhon uses wavelets to represent sketch input. Those wavelets are then used to train hidden Markov models. The HMMs can then be used to either classify new input, or (once input has been classified) to generate alternate geometry as appropriate. 

He has an associated video that illustrates the idea more clearly than the thesis does. The video shows how a user can draw things in a domain such as "desert island drawings". The user's sketch will be interpreted in context of that domain and can be re-drawn using generative wavelets. For example, a straight horizontal line stretching from the left to right side of a desert island scene is most likely the surface of the water. This is then rendered as a bunch of waves as we would expect a child to draw.

The thesis is really quite mathy, though the discussion of Markov models (hidden and not-so-hidden) is remarkably coherent.

The drawings showed a variety of styles ranging from pictures of spiders and robots to visual depictions of algorithms. Nearly all drawings followed an ad-hoc visual grammar consisting of elements such as dots, lines, arrows, boxes, clouds. Further, the ad-hoc notation gave special significance to constrained relations such as "line attached to container" that seemed to hold consistent meaning. While IS students are not explicitly taught to sketch, there is remarkable convergence in drawing styles nonetheless. Near the end he gives a table that maps symbols (e.g. dots, lines) and compound symbols (e.g. lines diverging from container) to conceptual metaphors (e.g. dots may mean documents, short lines in succession may mean text).},

	Abstract = {An interactive computer graphics system may be used for describing procedures in a two-dimensional programming language as well as for the more usual task of manipulating graphical data. The work described here is concerned with the graphical specification of prodcedures which then may be applied to problem data obtained from any source. The notation used to form a two-dimensional description of a procedure and the conventions used to control the procedure's execution are described.

An experimental graphical programming system has been created for the TX-2 Computer. With this system one may draw an arbitrary symbol and give it a meaning. The system has a "macro" capability enabling a new symbol to be defined as a combination of operators. A procedure may be executed after initial values are assigned. A number of debugging features are included in the system.

The conventions described make a graphical procedure description a natural way of expressing parallel operations. The standard notions of flow must be substantially modified. Explicit flow control is generally omitted but may be included at the users option. Some aspects of compiling from a graphical program are also discussed.},
