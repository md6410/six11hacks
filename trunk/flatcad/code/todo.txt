I'm in the middle of re-writing the code that prints the
model. Earlier there were two modes:

A) Every complete polygon is its own part. When FlatCAD generates HPGL
it separates all polygons so that they don't overlap. The benefit is
hat FlatCAD will automatically lay things out for you. On the down
side, it would be impossible to make parts with holes in them, such as
a taurus.

B) The screen is considered to be a sheet of material, and all lines
are considered to be cuts. This lets you make parts with holes in
them. However, the programmer must explicitly position each part
on the screen.

What I am going for is a combination of these two: when the programmer
is making a single piece that involves multiple polygons, they simply
indicate that they are making a new part. Then they draw that part's
geometry as usual. When the part is done, they simply begin a new
part. FlatCAD will then take each part and lay them out so they don't
overlap, while trying to be efficient with the material.

I'm not done yet. But I did manage to fix an efficiency bug. The old
gear-experimentive.fl program would take about 20 seconds to draw. Now
it draws in about 2 seconds.
