This is the top-level directory for FlatCAD. There are three
directories here (or at least, there are as of 2/5/07):

code/ 

        This is the directory you need if you only want to develop
        FlatCAD or compile it. I made it separate because this is what
        you need 99% of the time, and the other dirs can be large
        downloads. The most current version of flatcad is always in
        the 'src/' folder. Older versions are in
        old-src/old-flatcad-nn, the oldest of which is 01.

        Papers written on FlatCAD, screenshots, and other large
        binaries. Mostly this is here because I need a backup.

        Screenshots, mostly.
