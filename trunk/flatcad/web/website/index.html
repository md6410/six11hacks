	    FlatCAD is a 3D modeling environment controlled by
	    programming in a domain-specific language called
	    FlatLang. The physical objects on the side of this page
	    were all designed with FlatCAD and manufactured on a laser
	    cutter.

	    <b>New paper!</b> FlatCAD was presented at VL/HCC 2008. <a

	    This work was done in the <a
	    href="http://code.arc.cmu.edu/">Computational Design
	    Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon
	    University</a>. It was primarily written by <a
	    href="http://code.arc.cmu.edu/lab/html/person102.html">Gabe
	    Johnson</a> with lots of guidance from <a
	    href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mdg2/">Mark
	    D. Gross</a>. It was funded by NSF Grant ITR-0326054.

	    You can download FlatCAD and try your hand in programming
	    in FlatLang and making physical constructions of your
	    own. If you are familiar with LOGO, FlatLang should be
	    relatively easy to pick up. Just pick one of the binaries
	    below. The Java source code is available under the <a
	    href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GPL
