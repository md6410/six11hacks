FlatLang and FlatCAD: Construction Kits by Code


The FlatCAD system lets you create your own construction kits by
coding in the LOGO-like FlatLang language. No longer must construction
kit pieces be merely a product designed by someone else: if you can
write a simple FlatLang program, you can design a kit. This paper
describes our domain-specific language's features, debugging
environment, and example output.
